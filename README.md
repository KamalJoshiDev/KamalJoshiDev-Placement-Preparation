# 🧠 Placement Preparation Journey

Welcome to my **Placement Preparation Repository**!

This repo is my personal learning log where I revise and practice important concepts daily to prepare for placement season. I’m covering everything from **DSA**, **Development**, **System Design**, to **CS Fundamentals**, and more.

## 📅 Daily Update Pattern

Every day, I push a new folder like:

- 📁 `Day 1`
- 📁 `Day 2`
- 📁 `Day 3`
- ...

Inside each folder, you'll find code and notes related to what I revised or practiced on that particular day.
